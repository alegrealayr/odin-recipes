    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.

          Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
          garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
          simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

        ><span>
          While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted
          water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
          occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
          Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven
          to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</span

          Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon

        <strong>Step 7</strong
        ><span>
          Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
          9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
          over the sauce to cover.

        <strong>Step 8</strong
        ><span>
          Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and
          1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the
          remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the
          baking dish with aluminum foil.</span

        <strong>Step 9</strong
        ><span>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
          bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
