    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I’ll be very honest and say that there’s definitely a reason why sushi
      chefs spend a decade learning how to perfect sushi rice or cut raw fish
      like a boss, because it does make a difference. Homemade sushi will never
      be at the level of what you’d get from the top sushi restaurants in NYC,
      but here’s where homemade sushi rolls win: You get to gorge yourself on a
      FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of food at a restaurant would
      cost a couple hundred. Soooooo worth it, if you ask me.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
      <li>2/3 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/4 tablespoons salt</li>
      <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
      <li>1/2 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
      <li>1 avocado-peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong
        ><span>
          Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees
          C).</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong
        ><span>
          Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to
          medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been
          absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</span

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong
        ><span>
          Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into
          cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</span

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong><span> Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong
        ><span>
          Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 o 2 minutes.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6</strong
        ><span>
          Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a
          thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado,
          cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the
          center.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 7</strong
        ><span>
          Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a
          complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 8</strong
        ><span>
          Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices</span
