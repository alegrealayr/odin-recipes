    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to Mexican birria, barbacoa is more traditionally made from beef
      cheeks, but it can also be made from various cuts of beef, or even lamb,
      or goat. It really varies among the different regions of Mexico. But
      here’s the gist of it – it’s heavily seasoned meat with spices and
      chipotle peppers, then slow-cooked in a pit with coals or over an open
      flame until you’ve got beautifully juicy, fall-apart tender meat.

          Cook on Low, adding more water if it has evaporated, until meat is
          very tender, 7 to 8 hours. Remove foil packet from slow cooker and
          shred meat using 2 forks.</span
